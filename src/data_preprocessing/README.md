# src/data_preprocessing/

This directory hosts scripts and workflows for initial data processing steps such as:
- Filtering raw metabarcoding sequences.
- Computing pairwise similarities between sequences.
- Assigning sequences to existing MOTUs or creating new MOTUs if no match is found.

These scripts help maintain the dynamic and growing MOTU reference database.
